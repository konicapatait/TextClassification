# TextClassification

We're going to be using Google's Tensorflow package: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials

We're using an API wrapper for Tensorflow called ktrain. It's absolutely fabulous because it really abstracts the whole deep learning process into a workflow so easy, even a computational social scientist can do it: https://github.com/amaiya/ktrain

The Python code can be executed via Google colab.

## Prerequisite
*  Access to Google Colab
* Google Colab must have access to google Drive
* The data file must be available in google drive at /content/drive/MyDrive/MSDS/ColabNotebooks/marketing_text_analytics/master_files/text_classification/news_category_trainingdata.json location.
